	abstract = {We describe an extension to the "best-basis" method to select an orthonormal basis suitable for signal/image classification problems from a large collection of orthonormal bases consisting of wavelet packets or local trigonometric bases. The original best-basis algorithm selects a basis minimizing entropy from such a "library of orthonormal bases" whereas the proposed algorithm selects a basis maximizing a certain discriminant measure (e.g., relative entropy) among classes. Once such a basis is selected, a small number of most significant coordinates (features) are fed into a traditional classifier such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) or Classification and Regression Tree (CARTTM). The performance of these statistical methods is enhanced since the proposed methods reduce the dimensionality of the problem at hand without losing important information for that problem. Here, the basis functions which are well-localized in the time-frequency plane are used as feature extractors. We applied our method to two signal classification problems and an image texture classification problem. These experiments show the superiority of our method over the direct application of these classifiers on the input signals. As a further application, we also describe a method to extract signal component from data consisting of signal and textured background.},

	abstract = {Wavelets are of wide potential use in statistical contexts. The basics of the discrete wavelet transform are reviewed using a filter notation that is useful subsequently in the paper. A ‘stationary wavelet transform’, where the coefficient sequences are not decimated at each stage, is described. Two different approaches to the construction of an inverse of the stationary wavelet transform are set out. The application of the stationary wavelet transform as an exploratory statistical method is discussed, together with its potential use in nonparametric regression. A method of local spectral density estimation is developed. This involves extensions to the wavelet context of standard time series ideas such as the periodogram and spectrum. The technique is illustrated by its application to data sets from astronomy and veterinary anatomy.},

Although these functions do not form an orthonormal basis, their properties make them useful for signal and image analysis. Unlike wavelet-based orthonormal representations, the present representation has (1) symmetric analyzing functions, (2) shift-invariance, (3) associated iterative interpolation schemes, and (4) a simple algorithm for finding the locations of the multiscale edges as zero-crossings. The authors also develop a noniterative method for reconstructing signals from their zero-crossings (and slopes at these zero-crossings) in their representation. This method reduces the reconstruction problem to that of solving a system of linear algebraic equations.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

A corresponding shift-invariant wavelet packet decomposition (SIWPD) search algorithm for a "best basis" is introduced. The search algorithm is representable by a binary tree, in which a node symbolizes an appropriate subspace of the original signal. We prove that the resultant "best basis" is orthonormal and the associated expansion, characterized by the lowest "information cost", is shift-invariant. The shift-invariance stems from an additional degree of freedom, generated at the decomposition stage, and incorporated into the search algorithm. We prove that for any subspace it suffices to consider one of two alternative decompositions, made feasible by the SWP library. The computational complexity of SIWPD may be controlled at the expense of the attained information cost, to an extent of O(2Nlog/sub 2/N).},

	abstract = {We attempt to recover a function of unknown smoothness from noisy sampled data. We introduce a procedure, SureShrink, that suppresses noise by thresholding the empirical wavelet coefficients. The thresholding is adaptive: A threshold level is assigned to each dyadic resolution level by the principle of minimizing the Stein unbiased estimate of risk (Sure) for threshold estimates. The computational effort of the overall procedure is order N · log(N) as a function of the sample size N. SureShrink is smoothness adaptive: If the unknown function contains jumps, then the reconstruction (essentially) does also; if the unknown function has a smooth piece, then the reconstruction is (essentially) as smooth as the mother wavelet will allow. The procedure is in a sense optimally smoothness adaptive: It is near minimax simultaneously over a whole interval of the Besov scale; the size of this interval depends on the choice of mother wavelet. We know from a previous paper by the authors that traditional smoothing methods--kernels, splines, and orthogonal series estimates--even with optimal choices of the smoothing parameter, would be unable to perform in a near-minimax way over many spaces in the Besov scale. Examples of SureShrink are given. The advantages of the method are particularly evident when the underlying function has jump discontinuities on a smooth background.},

These can be viewed as generalizations of the hierarchical discrete cosine transform and the Haar-Walsh wavelet packet transform, respectively, from regularly sampled signals to graph signals. Both of these transforms generate dictionaries containing an immense number of choosable bases, and in order to select a particular basis most suitable for a given task, we have generalized the best basis algorithm from classical signal processing. After briefly reviewing these transforms and the best basis algorithm, we precisely prove their efficiency in approximating graph signals belonging to discrete analogs of the space of Holder continuous functions and the Besov spaces. Then, we validate their effectiveness with numerical experiments on real datasets, in which we compare them against other graph-based transforms. Building upon this approximation efficiency of our transforms, we devise a signal denoising method using the HGLET and GHWT and again compare against other transforms. Our results clearly demonstrate the superiority of our transforms over those other transforms in terms of both approximation and denoising.},

	abstract = {Wavelets are a relatively recent development in applied mathematics. Their name itself was coined approximately a decade ago (Morlet, Arens, Fourgeau, and Giard (1982), Morlet (1983), Grossmann and Morlet (1984)); in the last ten years interest in them has grown at an explosive rate. There are several reasons for their present success. On the one hand, the concept of wavelets can be viewed as a synthesis of ideas which originated during the last twenty or thirty years in engineering (subband coding), physics (coherent states, renormalization group), and pure mathematics (study of Calderón—Zygmund operators). As a consequence of these interdisciplinary origins, wavelets appeal to scientists and engineers of many different backgrounds. On the other hand, wavelets are a fairly simple mathematical tool with a great variety of possible applications. Already they have led to exciting applications in signal analysis (sound, images) (some early references are Kronland-Martinet, Morlet and Grossmann (1987), Mallat (1989b), (1989c); more recent references are given later) and numerical analysis (fast algorithms for integral transforms in Beylkin, Coifman, and Rokhlin (1991)); many other applications are being studied. This wide applicability also contributes to the interest they generate. This book contains ten lectures I delivered as the principal speaker at the CBMS conference on wavelets organized in June 1990 by the Mathematics Department at the University of Lowell, Massachusetts. According to the usual format of the CBMS conferences, other speakers (G. Battle, G. Beylkin, C. Chui, A. Cohen, R. Coifman, K. Gröchenig, J. Liandrat, S. Mallat, B. Torrésani, and A. Willsky) provided lectures on their work related to wavelets. Moreover, three workshops were organized, on applications to physics and inverse problems (chaired by B. DeFacio), group theory and harmonic analysis (H. Feichtinger), and signal analysis (M. Vetterli). The audience consisted of researchers active in the field of wavelets as well as of mathematicians and other scientists and engineers who knew little about wavelets and hoped to learn more. This second group constituted the largest part of the audience. I saw it as my task to provide a tutorial on wavelets to this part of the audience, which would then be a solid grounding for more recent work exposed by the other lecturers and myself.},

In reality, however, truly independent coordinates may not exist for a given set of images, or it may be computationally too difficult to obtain such coordinates. Therefore, it makes sense to obtain the least statistically dependent coordinate system efficiently. This basis--we call it Least Statistically-Dependent Basis (LSDB)--can be rapidly computed by minimizing the sum of the differential entropy of each coordinate in the basis library. This criterion is quite different from the Joint Best Basis (JBB) proposed by Wickerhauser. We demonstrate the use of the LSDB for image modeling and compare its performance with JBB and Karhunen-Loeve Basis.},
